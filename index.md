## Hello World

I'm Ygor Sousa, a computer scientist passionate about creating new things. I recently finished my PhD in Computer Science at the Centro de Inform√°tica - Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (CIn/UFPE, Brazil). I also hold an MSc degree in Computer Science also from CIn/UFPE, and a BSc degree in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE), where I graduated with great honors. Furthermore, as a highlight among my other technical qualifications, I hold a Specialization in Self-Driving Cars from the University of Toronto - Coursera and I have experience in creating Android applications from conception, participating in all stages of the creation and development process.

My most recent research interests have focused on Semantic Mapping for Indoor Mobile Robotics, covering various topics such as Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Transfer Learning, Representation Learning, Computer Vision, Neural Networks, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Learning.
