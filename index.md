## Hello World

I am Ygor, a Brazilian guy trying to create new methods and technological solutions to help people in their daily activities. I am a PhD student at the Centro de Informatica - Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (CIn/UFPE). I hold an MSc degree in Computer Science from CIn/UFPE, and a BSc degree in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE), where I graduated with honors. Furthermore, as a highlight among my other technical qualifications, I hold a Specialization in Self-Driving Cars from the University of Toronto - Coursera.

My research focuses on Machine Learning applied to Mobile Robotics, covering Scene Understanding, Mapping, Computer Vision, Representation Learning, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Learning.
