## Hello World

I'm Ygor, a Brazilian guy trying to create new technological solutions to help people in their daily activities. I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the Centro de Informatica - Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (CIn/UFPE), an MSc degree in Computer Science also from CIn/UFPE, and a BSc degree in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE), where I graduated with great honors. Furthermore, as a highlight among my other technical qualifications, I hold a Specialization in Self-Driving Cars from the University of Toronto - Coursera.

My research focuses on Machine Learning applied to Mobile Robotics, covering Semantic Scene Understanding, Mapping, Computer Vision, Deep Learning for Visual Perception, Representation Learning, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Learning.
